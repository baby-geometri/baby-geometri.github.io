  abstract: Our framework here is low dimensional topology, and the main protagonists are
    Legendrian submanifolds, i.e. those which remains obediently tangent to the
    contact hyperplan distribution. We will see the subtleties brought by Legendrian
    knots in comparison with classical smooth knots, and understand the natural
    cobordism notion coming out, initiated by Arnol'd in the early 80's\(:\)
    "What is a Legendrian surface between two Legendrian knots?"
    There will be infinitely many trivial knots, some bow ties, one swallow tail...
    and a lot of drawings.

  titolo: Dynamics on translation surfaces\(:\) a (very very very) short survey
  data: "28 maggio"
  luogo: "aula seminari"
  ora: "16.30"
  abstract: Translation surfaces are surfaces which come naturally into play both from a dynamical motivation (billiards in polygons) and from a more algebro-geometrical point of view (they are related to the Teichmuller space). We will start with some examples, give some motivations about why one is interested in them and then focus more on the dynamical side. We will give a short survey of some more or less classical result from the very rich literature. Time permitting, we will also relate this to some Diophantine approximation.
