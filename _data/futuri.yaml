  abstract: Our framework here is low dimensional topology, and the main protagonists are
    Legendrian submanifolds, i.e. those which remains obediently tangent to the
    contact hyperplan distribution. We will see the subtleties brought by Legendrian
    knots in comparison with classical smooth knots, and understand the natural
    cobordism notion coming out, initiated by Arnol'd in the early 80's\(:\)
    "What is a Legendrian surface between two Legendrian knots?"
    There will be infinitely many trivial knots, some bow ties, one swallow tail...
    and a lot of drawings.
