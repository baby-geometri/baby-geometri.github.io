  abstract: Derived categories were introduced by Grothendieck and Verdier around 1960, and since then they have been widely used in algebraic geometry. In this talk, I will try to motivate their use and present some of the questions that arise in the world of derived categories. I will begin by presenting two examples that will hopefully convince you that sometimes we need to “go derived”. Then, I’ll define derived categories and move on to questions such as derived equivalence and the study of the group of autoequivalences of a derived category.
