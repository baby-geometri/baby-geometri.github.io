  abstract: (Prerequisites\(:\) Differential manifolds and forms, basic algebraic topology) In 1989 Witten used ideas coming from gauge theory to give topological invariants of links and 3-manifolds; however his ideas were not mathematically sound. I will discuss his original approach and define rigorously the colored Jones function, which is the most important invariant in Witten's framework.
